THIS IS NOT INTEGRATED WITH THE CODE.
THE CODE ASSUMES ONLY SIMPLE BETA PROFILE

option 1:
simpleBetaProfile:

In this function I am using the simple beta profile with beta = 0.666 and using
classic beta function to claculate surfacebrightness. Here I am assuming 
xc = Rc/R500 = 0.2 and there is no scattering in beta and fc. 

option 2:
simpleDoubleBetaProfile:

In this function I am using double beta profile prescription to mimic CC and NCC
component. Here I am assuming just one varibale for beta_1 and beta_2. Really it
is not CC/NCC but it gets closer to that point. xc has the same definition as
option 1 and fS = S02/S01. Look at option 3 for CC/NCC component.
beta1 = 0.666, beta2 = 0.666, xc1 = 0.2, xc2 = 0.2, fS = 1 (I should change
this parameters)

option 3:
simpleCCandNCCProfile  
combination of option 1 and 2 with fCC = number of CC clusters / tot number of clusters
